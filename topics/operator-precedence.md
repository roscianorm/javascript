# OPERATOR PRECEDENCE

[Operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence) determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.

The following [table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table) lists operators in order from highest precedence (21) to lowest precedence (1).
